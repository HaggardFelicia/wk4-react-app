Q: What's next??

A: Full Stack Development w/ ReactJS and NodeJS

- So, next class you will be creating a frontend with ReactJS and a backend with NodeJS.

## Requirements for this assignment

- [ ] Create a full-stack application using your collections from the last assignments. See the video below on how to complete this assignment.
- [ ] The styling for the client can be minimal.

### Rubric

#### Assignment Submission

- [ ] The code in the video was explained and the GitHub repo was successfully linked.

#### Exemplary Code Quality and Structure

- [ ] Code structure is broken into modules and imported correctly. Code is consistent and clean across the entire project. Commented on with README
  - [ ] Modularization:
    - [ ] Breaks down the code into manageable modules, separating concerns logically.
    - [ ] Properly imports and uses required modules.
  - [ ] Code Readability:
    - [ ] Follows a consistent and clean coding style (indentation, naming conventions).
    - [ ] Uses meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
  - [ ] Comments and Documentation:
  - [ ] Includes inline comments to explain complex logic or important code blocks.
  - [ ] Provides README.md brief overview of the application's structure and functionality. Along with a way to install npm packages and run the Node server.

#### Exemplary Full Stack Application

- [ ] A functional full stack application that successfully connects to your backend and can modify the information in the database.
  - [ ] Well-organized folder structure.
  - [ ] Clear separation of components and containers.
  - [ ] Consistent coding style and formatting
  - [ ] Well-designed, reusable React components.
  - [ ] Components follow best practices.
  - [ ] Effective use of state and props
  - [ ] API calls are successful when retrieving and modifying the information in the database.
  - [ ] List of information is loaded on page load with useEffect hook correctly.

#### Exemplary API Integration

- [ ] The full stack application has full connection from the server side on to the client side.
  - [ ] Seamless integration between the backend and frontend
  - [ ] Data flow is well-managed.

#### Exemplary State Management

- [ ] The client side has proper state management.
  - [ ] Effective implementation of state management.
  - [ ] Proper use of React state, context, or state management libraries (e.g., Redux)
  - [ ] useEffect of loading the data on page load.
